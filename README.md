# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project uses **Machine Learning** to classify breast cancer tumors as **Malignant (Cancerous)** or **Benign (Non-Cancerous)** using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset** from Scikit-learn.  
The goal is to assist in early detection of breast cancer and improve diagnostic accuracy through predictive modeling.

## Features
- Uses **Scikit-learn’s built-in Breast Cancer dataset**
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Model training using **Logistic Regression**
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualization of results with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
